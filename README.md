# Portfolio Website

I designed and developed this project using Bootstrap 4.0, custom CSS3 and flexbox. 
I downloaded the bootstrap CSS and javascript files from bootstrap website (https://getbootstrap.com/). 
I also used Google Fonts (Frank Ruhl Libre and Roboto which can linked at (https://fonts.google.com/). 
I used font awesome for icons which can be found at (https://fontawesome.com/).

This is how the site looks:
